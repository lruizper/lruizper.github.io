# {{ Dr. Lanie Ruiz-Perez}} - Portfolio Task
[My portfolio site] ( https://lruizper.github.io/ )
## Project Requirements
### Content
My page contains a (very old) profile pic which I'm hoping to replace
when we get the one taken for the She Codes cohort next week ;)
Most of the content is taken from LinkedIn bio and some GPT sentences.
I made the little logo.png very quickly on draw.io because I found canva a bit overwhelming
I downloaded the little logos of external pages and put them in the footer
There is display flex being applied to the header, footer and the portfolio section of the main page which are responsive to the one media query in my CSS.
In the header I have hyperlikns styled as buttons with hover action. The 'Bio' button takes you to the second page (under construction) and the logo refers to the main page. The 'Porfolio' button refers to the portfolio section, and the same with the 'contact' button.
The second page is not very populated yet but it displays the same header and footer and a Heading 1 with 
a little notice saying more content is comming
The contact form is functional in that it sends an email to my personal gmail without it being filtered by spam filters.
The porfolio section has five 'projects' which appear on orientation colum on mobile and in row by pairs when on larger displays, due to the media query.
- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
### Technical
{{ Add a short paragraph describing the features below. }}
I have two web pages: the main and the Bio (currently empty)
Currently using my ubuntu CLI to interact with the local and remote repos
The page is deployed as per instructions on git hub pages
The page was developed on mobile sized screens first and the the media query takes care of 
responsive design for the larger screens
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.
### Bonus (optional)
{{ Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. }}
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra
tricky!)
