# {{ Dr. Lanie Ruiz-Perez}} - Portfolio Task
[My portfolio site] ( https://lruizper.github.io/ )
## Project Requirements
### Content
- [ ]Profile Picture: I currently have a temporary profile picture, which will be updated soon with a new one from the She Codes cohort.
- [ ]Biography: The content of my portfolio is derived from my LinkedIn bio and supplemented with some information generated using GPT.
- [ ]Logo: I created a simple logo using draw.io, as I found Canva a bit overwhelming. It's a work in progress.
- [ ]External Links: I've included logos of external pages (e.g., GitHub and LinkedIn) in the footer section.
- [ ]Responsive Design: I've applied responsive design principles using CSS Flexbox. The header, footer, and portfolio section adapt to different screen sizes, thanks to a media query in my CSS.
- [ ]Navigation: In the header, I've styled hyperlinks as buttons with hover effects. The 'Bio' button leads to a second page (currently under construction), and the logo links back to the main page. Similarly, the 'Portfolio' and 'Contact' buttons direct users to their respective sections.
- [ ]Second Page: The second page is a work in progress, featuring the same header and footer. It currently displays a heading indicating that more content is coming soon.
- [ ]Contact Form: The contact form is fully functional and sends emails to my personal Gmail account without being caught in spam filters.
- [ ]Portfolio Section: The portfolio section showcases five projects. On mobile devices, they appear in a vertical orientation, while on larger displays, they are displayed in rows of pairs, thanks to the media query.
### Technical
- [ ]Web Pages: I've created two web pages - the main page and a bio page (currently under construction).
- [ ]Version Control: I'm using Git for version control. This allows me to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage my project effectively.
- [ ]Deployment: The webpage is deployed on GitHub Pages, following the provided instructions. This makes it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
- [ ]Responsive Design: I've prioritized mobile-first development. The page layout and styling are designed for smaller screens, and a media query is implemented to ensure responsiveness on larger screens. This approach ensures a consistent user experience across various devices.
- [ ]Semantic HTML: I've used semantic HTML elements to structure the content.
### Bonus (optional)
- [ ]When users hover over the navigation links in the header (styled as buttons), they experience a visual change, providing feedback that the links are interactive.
